# GD_Data_Ecosystem
The Results & Delivery Unit at the Privy Council office and the GC Data Community hosted at the Canada School of Public Service are facilitating a collaborative effort to chart the GC Data Ecosystem. 

The GC data ecosystem is complex and most are only aware of small cuts of the whole, the goal of the collaboration is to collectively put together the pieces to the puzzle. 

The project will evolve as the community gets engaged, new information is added and uses for the views are explored. In other words, the precise “what” will emerge based on need.
